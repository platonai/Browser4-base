/**
 * Captures the runtime context for a single agent execution step.
 *
 * An [ExecutionContext] is the glue object passed through observe/act/extract flows. It keeps the original
 * instruction, the current step/event identity, the current [AgentState], and the shared session-level artifacts
 * that later prompts and persistence rely on.
 *
 * Although this is a `data class`, it is intentionally stateful:
 * - A new instance is created for each step/event pair, but [sessionId] stays stable across a multistep run.
 * - [agentState] is updated in place as the agent observes, acts, and records results for the current step.
 * - [stateHistory] is shared session history, not a defensive copy, so later contexts see prior successful steps.
 * - [screenshotB64] may be attached after construction when a prompt needs the latest screenshot.
 *
 * Important usage notes:
 * - Prefer building contexts through `AgentStateManager`; it enforces step progression, state inheritance, and
 *   persistence side effects. Constructing this class directly is mainly appropriate for tests.
 * - Keep [instruction] stable throughout a multistep session. Advance the workflow with [step] and [event] instead
 *   of rewriting the goal mid-session.
 * - [uuid] is unique per context instance and is used as the request identifier for downstream extraction calls.
 *
 * @property step The logical step number. `0` is used for standalone or bootstrap contexts; positive values represent
 * the ordered steps of a multistep run.
 * @property instruction The user goal being executed. This should remain consistent across all contexts in one session.
 * @property screenshotB64 The latest screenshot snapshot, when one is attached for prompting or debugging.
 * @property event The lifecycle event handled by this context, such as `act`, `observe`, `extract`, or `summary`.
 * @property targetUrl The page URL the step is expected to operate on. This is often inherited from the previous state.
 * @property agentState The mutable state snapshot for the current step.
 * @property stateHistory The shared history of successful states accumulated during the current session.
 * @property config Agent configuration flags that influence prompt generation and persistence behavior.
 * @property sessionId Stable session identifier reused by all related contexts in the same run.
 * @property stepStartTime Timestamp marking when this step context was created.
